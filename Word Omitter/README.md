# Word Omitter

You are tasked with creating a simple React application called "Word Omitter" that dynamically filters out specific words from the user input in real-time. The application requirements are detailed below, and the finished application must pass all of the unit tests.

**Detailed Requirements**

1.  The WordOmitter component takes an array of words to omit as a prop called omitWords. Each element of this array is a string representing a word that should be filtered out of the user's input.
2.  The application should display a text input field where the user can type a sentence.
3.  As the user types, the output area below the input field should display the sentence with the specified words omitted.
4.  The application should have a toggle button to switch between omitting the specified words and showing all words.
5.  The application should have a clear button that clears both the input field and the output area.
6.  If the input field is empty, the output area should also be empty.

  

**Sample Interaction**

**Initial State**

-   The input field is empty.
-   The output area is empty.
-   The button displays "Show All Words" i.e. Omit Mode is enabled

**User Action 1**

-   User types "This is a test sentence." in the input field.
-   The output area displays "This is test sentence." (assuming "a" is omitted).

**User Action 2**

-   User clicks the toggle button.
-   The output area now displays "This is a test sentence." (showing all words).

**User Action 3**  - User clicks the clear button. - Both the input field and the output area are cleared.
