**Detailed Requirements**

  

**1. Fields and Display:**

-   Input Field: Allows entry of the amount to be exchanged.
-   Table: Displays "Exchange Rate" and "Number of Coins" for each cryptocurrency.

**2. User Interactions:**

-   Users input an amount within their available balance.
-   Amount is mandatory, ranging from $0.01 to the available balance.
-   If invalid, show an error message.
-   By default, the input field is empty with no error message and "Number of Coins" as 0.00000000.
-   Table updates dynamically as the amount is modified.

**3. Conversion Calculation**

-   "Number of Coins" = (Amount * Exchange Rate), rounded to 8 decimal places.
-   Invalid amounts display "n/a" in the "Number of Coins" column.

**. Error Messages**

-   Empty input: "Amount cannot be empty".
-   Amount <  0.01".
-   Amount > available balance: "Amount cannot exceed the available balance".
